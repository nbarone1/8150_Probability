# Cheating Casino

import numpy as np

size = 200
beta = 1/2

system = np.random.choice([-1,1],size)

# The next step is to generate Y values based on the randomly formed system
# The idea behind a beta of 1/2 is based on research done on 1D Ising systems of electromagnetism.
# The rest of this problem I did not get to work out thoroughly.
# There were issues with travel and attending my sister's graduation that cut into time spent on problem 3.
